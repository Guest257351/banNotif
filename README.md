## [bot](bot)
this folder contains the released version of the bot
you can change the role the bot gives on line 30 and the channel it sends alerts on line 29
## [botV2](botV2)
this folder contains an unfinished version of the bot that is much more polished and has support for multiple servers, channels, and dming.

### notes
both of these bots require a config file in the same directory that looks like this:
```python
token = 'PUT BOT TOKEN HERE'
prefix = 'b!'
admins = []
devs = [470896949529411585]
```
